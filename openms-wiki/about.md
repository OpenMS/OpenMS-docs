OpenMS is an open-source C++ library for Mass Spectrometry (MS) data management and analyses. It offers an infrastructure for the rapid development of mass spectrometry-related software. OpenMS is free software available under the [three-clause BSD license](https://github.com/OpenMS/OpenMS-docs/blob/main/LICENSE). It is available for Windows, macOS and Linux.

OpenMS comes with a vast variety of pre-built and ready-to-use tools for proteomics and metabolomics data analysis (TOPP tools), and powerful 2D and 3D visualisation (TOPPView). It supports analyses for various quantification protocols, including label-free shotgun proteomics, SILAC, iTRAQ, SRM, and SWATH. It also provides built-in algorithms for peptide/protein identification, both de-novo and via database searching, as well as adapters to state-of-the-art tools like X! Tandem, Mascot, OMSSA, and others.

Through the TOPP tools concept and unified parameter handling (CTD), OpenMS supports easy integration into workflow engines like TOPPAS (included), KNIME, Galaxy, and WS-PGRADE.

With pyOpenMS, OpenMS offers Python bindings to a large part of the API to enable rapid computational mass spectrometry development.

OpenMS supports the Proteomics Standard Initiative (PSI) file formats for MS data.

The main contributors of OpenMS are currently Eberhard-Karls Universität in Tübingen, Freie Universität Berlin and ETH Zurich.
