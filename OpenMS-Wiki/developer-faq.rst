Troubleshooting
***************

OpenMS complains about boost not being found but I'm sure its there!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CMake got confused. Set up a new build directory and try again. If you build in-source (not recommended), deleting the CMakeCache.txt and cmake directory might help.

General information
*******************

I am new to OpenMS. What should I do first?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Check out the developement version of OpenMS (see website).
* Try and build OpenMS according to the installation instructions.
* Read the OpenMS Coding Convention.
* Read the OpenMS Tutorial.
* Create a GitHub account
* Register to the open-ms-general and open-ms-developers mailing list. (You can see the developers list only if you are logged in to Sourceforge and if you are a OpenMS developer).

What is the difference between an OpenMS tool and util?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A tool starts its lifecycle in UTILS and may exist without beeing thoroughly tested. Tools may be promoted from UTILS to TOOLS if they are stable enough, are fully tested, fully documented and a test workflow exists.

I have written a class for OpenMS I want to contribute. What should I do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Basically, you must conform to the OpenMS Coding conventions :

Coding style (brackets, variable names, etc.) must conform to the conventions.

* The class and all the members must be documented thoroughly.
* You can check your code with the tool `tools/checker.php`. Call `php tools/checker.php` for detailed instructions.

Please open a pull request and follow the `checklist <https://github.com/OpenMS/OpenMS/wiki/Pull-Request-Checklist>`_

How do I update the `openms.de <https://www.openms.de website>`_?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Login to the wordpress admin area at www.openms.de/wp-admin with your username and password assigned by the current Homepage maintainers.

Can I use QT designer to create GUI widgets?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yes! If you want to create a class called `Widget: Create .ui-File` with `QT designer` and store it as `Widget.ui.`, add the class to  `sources.cmake`.
From the .ui-File the file `include/OpenMS/VISUAL/UIC/ClassTemplate.h` is generated by the build system.
DO NOT CHECK-IN THIS FILE, AS IT IS GENERATED AUTOMATICALLY, WHEN NEEDED!!!
Derive the class `Widget` from `WidgetTemplate`. You need to check in the `Widget.h` and `Widget.cpp` files.

Can the START_SECTION-macro not handle template methods that have two or more arguments?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Put round brackets around the method declaration. Then it should work.

Where can I find the binary installers created?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

https://abibuilder.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/archive/openms/OpenMSInstaller/nightly/.
Please verify the creation date of the individual installers, as there may have been an error while creating the installer.

Build system
************

What is cmake?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CMake builds BuildSystems for different platforms, e.g. VisualStudio Solutions on Windows, Makefiles on Linux etc.
This allows us to define in one central location (namely CMakeLists.txt) how OpenMS is build and have the platform specific stuff handled by CMake. 
See http://www.cmake.org for more information.
