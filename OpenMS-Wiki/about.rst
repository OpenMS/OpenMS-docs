OpenMS is an open-source C++ library for mass spectrometry (MS) data management and analysis. It offers an infrastructure for the rapid development of mass spectrometry-related software. OpenMS is free software available under the three-clause BSD license. It runs under Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

OpenMS comes with a vast variety of pre-built and ready-to-use tools for proteomics and metabolomics data analysis (TOPP tools) and powerful 2D and 3D visualization (TOPPView). It supports analyses for various quantification protocols, including label-free shotgun, SILAC, iTRAQ, SRM, SWATH, .... It also provides built-in algorithms for peptide/protein identification, both de-novo and via database searching, as well as adapters to state-of-the art tools like X! Tandem,  Mascot, OMSSA and others.

Through the TOPP tools concept and unified parameter handling (CTD), OpenMS supports easy integration into workflow engines like TOPPAS (included), KNIME, Galaxy or WS-PGRADE.
With PyOpenMS, OpenMS offers Python bindings to a large part of the API to enable rapid algorithm development.

OpenMS supports the Proteomics Standard Initiative (PSI) file formats for MS data.
The main contributors of OpenMS are currently Eberhard-Karls Universität in Tübingen, Freie Universität Berlin and ETH Zurich.
