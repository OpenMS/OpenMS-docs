Getting Started with OpenMS
***************************
The current stable version of OpenMS can be downloaded from the `OpenMS download site <http://open-ms.de/downloads/>`_ or can be obtained via the `OpenMS docker containers <https://github.com/OpenMS/OpenMS/wiki/OpenMS-Docker-Containers>`_.

As a general primer to OpenMS, we also recommend to read `RÃ¶st et al, OpenMS: a flexible open-source software platform for mass spectrometry data analysis. Nat Methods. 2016 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27575624>`_ as well as the `Getting Started <http://www.openms.de/getting-started/>`_ page on openms.de.

Novice users should start by reading the OpenMS documentation (especially for TOPP) available from the `OpenMS documentation site <http://www.openms.de/current_doxygen/>`_ or in the folder doc/index.html of stable releases. Some example workflows with optimised parameter settings can be downloaded from the `repository <https://github.com/OpenMS/OpenMS/wiki/Workflow-Collection>`_. To understand which tools are available, please read the `TOPP Tool documentation page <http://www.openms.de/current_doxygen/html/TOPP_documentation.html>`_ as well as the `UTILS Tool documentation page <http://www.openms.de/current_doxygen/html/UTILS_documentation.html>`_.
