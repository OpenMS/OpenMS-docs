Graphical Tools
===============

OpenMS provides a suite of graphical applications, designed for users who want easy access to TOPP tools. These applications include:
- [INIFileEditor](graphical-topp-tools/ini-file-editor.md)

  A GUI application used to edit INI files. INI files are files with the extension .ini and are a common input file for mass spectrometry data.
- TOPP shell

  A Command Line Interface (CLI) that provides easy access to tools. Users donâ€™t need to use TOPP shell; instead, they can configure their own CLI to directly use TOPP tools.
- [TOPPView](graphical-topp-tools/toppview.md)

  A GUI application used to inspect, visualize and compare mass spectrometry data. Read more in-depth documentation about TOPPView.
- [TOPPAS (deprecated)](graphical-topp-tools/toppas.md)

  A GUI application used to apply multiple tools sequentially on mass spectrometry data. Applying multiple tools in a sequence is referred to as a workflow or a pipeline. OpenMS no longer supports TOPPAS and instead recommends the use of [KNIME](https://www.knime.com/), for which we provide a community plugin.
- [SwathWizard](graphical-topp-tools/swathwizard.md)

  An application for SWATH analysis. SwathWizard is used to analyze DIA swath data.
