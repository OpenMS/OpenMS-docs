Feature Grouping
================

In order to quantify differences across maps (label-free) or within a map (isotope-labeled), groups of corresponding
features have to be found. The **FeatureLinker** TOPP tools support both approaches. These groups are represented by
consensus features, which contain information about the constituting features in the maps as well as average position,
intensity, and charge.

## Isotope-labeled quantitation

To differentially quantify the features of an isotope-labeled HPLC-MS map, follow the listed steps:

1. The first step in this pipeline is to find the features of the HPLC-MS map. The FeatureFinder applications calculate
   the features from profile data or centroided data.
2. In the second step, the labeled pairs (e.g. light/heavy labels of ICAT) are determined by the **FeatureLinkerLabeled**
   application. **FeatureLinkerLabeled** first determines all possible pairs according to a given optimal shift and
   deviations in RT and m/z. Then it resolves ambiguous pairs using a greedy-algorithm that prefers pairs with a higher
   score. The score of a pair is the product of:

   - feature quality of feature 1
   - feature quality of feature 2
   - quality measure for the shift (how near is it to the optimal shift)

This algorithm assumes that the retention time axes of all input maps are very similar. To correct for
retention time distortions, please have a look at [Map alignment](map-alignment.md).
