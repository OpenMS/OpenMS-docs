## Run OpenMS inside a (Bio)Container

1. Install a containerization software (e.g., [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) or [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/quick_start.html#quick-installation-steps))

2. Pull an image from one of the following registries:

- [OpenMS GitHub Container Registry](https://ghcr.io) for nightly binaries AND releases:

	On our registry, we provide one image for the library (with contrib) and one for the executables (with thirdparty).

	1. [openms-library](https://ghcr.io/openms/openms-library)
	2. [openms-executables](https://ghcr.io/openms/openms-executables)

	They can be pulled/run via the following commands:

	::::{tab-set}

	:::{tab-item} Docker

	```{code-block} bash
	docker pull ghcr.io/openms/openms-library
	docker pull ghcr.io/openms/openms-executables
	```

	:::

	:::{tab-item} Singularity

	```{code-block} bash
	singularity run ghcr.io/openms/openms-library-sif
	singularity run ghcr.io/openms/openms-executables-sif
	```

	:::

	::::

	:::{note}
	Per default this results in the download of the latest nightly snapshot. Specify a release version (e.g.,
	{{ '`docker pull ghcr.io/openms/openms-library:{0}`'.format(version) }} to receive a stable version.
	:::

- Otherwise, the [BioContainers Registries](https://biocontainers.pro/registry) and the associated Galaxy
project provide native containers based on our bioconda packages for both Docker and Singularity.

	1. [BioContainers libopenms](https://biocontainers.pro/tools/libopenms)
	2. [BioContainers openms](https://biocontainers.pro/tools/openms)
	3. [BioContainers openms-thirdparty](https://biocontainers.pro/tools/openms-thirdparty)
	4. [BioContainers pyOpenMS](https://biocontainers.pro/tools/pyopenms)

	Images of the containers can be pulled via or one of the following commands:

	::::{tab-set}

	:::{tab-item} Docker

	```{code-block} bash
	docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/libopenms
	docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/openms
	docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/pyopenms
	docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/openms-thirdparty
	```

	:::

	:::{tab-item} Singularity

	```{code-block} bash
	singularity run https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/libopenms
	singularity run https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/openms
	singularity run https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/pyopenms
	singularity run https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/openms-thirdparty
	```

	:::

	::::

:::{note}
If Singularity images fail to download or run, try to use the Docker images as Singularity will automatically convert them.

Dockerfiles to build different kind of images (e.g., for ArchLinux) yourself can be found on
GitHub in our [OpenMS/dockerfiles](https://github.com/OpenMS/dockerfiles) repository. They usually follow our build
instructions closely, so you can have a look on how this is done in a clean environment.
