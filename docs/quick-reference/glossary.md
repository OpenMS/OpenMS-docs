spectra
  Plural of spectrum.

mass spectrum
  A mass spectrum is a plot of the ion signal as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. A mass spectrum is produced by a single mass spectrometry run. These spectra are used to determine the elemental or isotopic signature of a sample, the masses of particles and of molecules, and to elucidate the chemical identity or structure of molecules and other chemical compounds. OpenMS represents a one dimensional mass spectrum using the class [MSSpectrum](https://openms.de/current_doxygen/html/classOpenMS_1_1MSSpectrum.html).

feature
  An LC-MS feature represents the combined isotopic mass traces of a detected chemical compound. The chromatographic peak shape of a feature is defined by the interaction of the analyte with the LC column. Each feature contains information on retention time, mass-to-charge ratio, intensity and overall quality. OpenMS represents a feature using the class [Feature](https://openms.de/current_doxygen/html/classOpenMS_1_1Feature.html).

feature map
  A feature map is a collection of features identified in a mass spectrum from a single experiment. One feature map can contain many features. OpenMS represents a feature map using the class [FeatureMap](https://openms.de/current_doxygen/html/classOpenMS_1_1FeatureMap.html).

consensus feature
  Features from replicate experiments with similar retention times and m/z values are linked and considered a consensus feature. A consensus feature contains information on the common retention time and m/z values as well as intensities for each sample. OpenMS represents a consensus feature using the class [ConsensusFeature](https://openms.de/current_doxygen/html/classOpenMS_1_1ConsensusFeature.html).

consensus map
  A consensus map is a collection of {term}`consensus features <consensus feature>` identified from mass spectra across replicate experiments. One consensus map can contain many consensus features. OpenMS represents a consensus map using the class [ConsensusMap](https://openms.de/current_doxygen/html/classOpenMS_1_1ConsensusMap.html).
