TOPP and OpenMS
==============

TOPP, the OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline provides a set of computational tools that can be easily combined into analysis
pipelines even by non-experts and then be used in proteomics workflows. These applications range from useful utilities
file format conversion, peak picking over wrapper applications for known applications (e.g. Mascot) to completely new
algorithmic techniques for data reduction and data analysis. TOPP is based on the OpenMS library and as more
functionality is added to new OpenMS releases, TOPP will naturally contain new or updated tools.

In addition to offering a toolbox, TOPP contains TOPPView - the central graphical user interface - which allows the user
to view, inspect and manipulate proteomics data. TOPPView reads standard formats and allows the user not only to view
the data, but also to interactively call TOPP tools and display the results. As such it is a powerful tool for
interactive data manipulation.

In this tutorial, let's understand in detail the capabilities of TOPPView and the TOPP tools using real data sets and
standard analysis tasks.
