TOPP and OpenMS
==============

{term}`TOPP`, the OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline provides a set of computational tools that can be easily combined into analysis
pipelines even by non-experts and then be used in proteomics workflows. These applications range from useful utilities
file format conversion, peak picking over wrapper applications for known applications (e.g.{term}`Mascot`) to completely new
algorithmic techniques for data reduction and data analysis. {term}`TOPP` is based on the OpenMS library and as more
functionality is added to new OpenMS releases, {term}`TOPP` will naturally contain new or updated tools.

In addition to offering a toolbox, {term}`TOPP` contains {term}`TOPPView` - the central graphical user interface - which
allows the user to view, inspect and manipulate {term}`proteomics` data. {term}`TOPPView` reads standard formats and
allows the user not only to view the data, but also to interactively call {term}`TOPP tools` and display the results.
As such it is a powerful tool for interactive data manipulation.

In this tutorial, let's understand in detail the capabilities of {term}`TOPPView` and the {term}`TOPP tools` using real
data sets and standard analysis tasks.
