TOPPView Introduction
=====================

TOPPView is a viewer for MS and HPLC-MS data. It can be used to inspect files in mzML, mzData, mzXML and several other
text-based file formats.

In each view, several datasets can be displayed using the layer concept. This allows visual comparison of several
datasets as well as displaying input data and output data of an algorithm together.

TOPPView is intended for visual inspection of the data by experimentalists as well as for analysis software by
developers.
