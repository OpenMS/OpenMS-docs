TOPP Tutorial
============

This tutorial is an introduction to TOPP and TOPPView. Let's start with understanding the intent and concept of TOPP
compared to OpenMS. Later, we will move to the handling of TOPPView which is our central GUI. Apart from viewing data,
TOPPView can also be used to analyze it using selected TOPP tools; how-to is explained in the third part of the tutorial.
Finally, the tutorial lists the command line interfaces for all TOPP tools contained in the release.
