TOPPAS Tutorial
==============

**TOPPAS** allows to create, edit, open, save, and run TOPP workflows. Pipelines can be created conveniently  in a GUI.
The parameters of all involved tools can be edited within TOPPAS and are also saved as part of the pipeline definition
 in the `.toppas` file.

```{important}
Active development of TOPPAS is stopped. In near future, TOPPAS will be completely deprecated. Please migrate to using
OpenMS KNIME integration.
