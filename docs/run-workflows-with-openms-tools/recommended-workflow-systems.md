# Recommended Workflow Systems

Which workflow environment to choose for running OpenMS tools?

You can run OpenMS TOPP tools from the command line using your custom scripts, or use powerful
workflow systems designed to make workflow creation and maintenance more fun:

:::{card} KNIME

:class-card: only-light
:class-img-top: halfwidth

Free, open source, desktop app. An analytics platform with workflow editor and a nice drag-and-drop user interface.
Very interactive and has built-in nodes for related tasks like working with chemical structures, databases, machine learning, scripting. Distributed computing is best achieved with a KNIME server (License required) which also allows user management
and a web interface to interact with workflows. In KNIME you can easily construct your own workflows or just download our
ready-made creations for the most common analysis tasks.

Script/DSL-based workflow language, executor and utilities (such as the browser based launcher and supervisor nf-tower). Automatically runs on various different cloud (AWS, Google, ...) and HPC environments (SLURM, LFS, Kubernetes, ...). It is recommended to use our ready-made nf-core compatible workflows for ease of use via the browser-based configuration and launcher.
