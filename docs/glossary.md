OpenMS Glossary
==============

A glossary of common terms used throughout OpenMS documentation.

```{glossary}
LC-MS
  [Liquid Chromatography(LC)](introduction.md#liquid-chromatography-lc) and [Mass Spectrometry(MS)](introduction.md#mass-spectrometry).

Peptides
  A short chain of amino acids.

Octadecyl(C18)
  An alkyl radical C~18~H~37~ derived from an octadecane by removal of one hydrogen atom.

Mass
  Mass is a measure of the amount of matter that an object contains. In comparison to often used term weight, which is
  a measure of the force of gravity on that object.

Ion
  Any {term}`atom` or group of atoms that bears one or more positive or negative electrical charges. Positively charged are
  cations, negavtively charged anions.

Atom
  An atom is the smallest unit of ordinary matter that forms a chemical element.

Electrospray ionization
  A technique used in mass spectrometry to produce ions using an electrospray in which a high voltage is applied to a
  liquid to create an {term}`aerosol`.

Aerosol
  An aerosol is a suspension of fine solid particles or liquid droplets in air or another gas.

Time-of-flight (TOF)
  A measurement of the time taken by an object, particle of wave (be it acoustic, electromagnetic, e.t.c) to travel a
  distance through a medium.

Quadrupole mass filters
  A mass filter allowing one mass channel at a time to reach the detector as the mass range is scanned.

Orbitrap analyzers
  In mass spectrometry, an ion trap mass analyzer consisting of an outer barrel-like electrode and a coaxial inner
  spindle-like electrode that traps ions in an orbital motion around the spindle.
  A high resoltion mass spectrometry analyzer.

MS(1)
  First stage to get a spectra. A sample is injected into the mass spectrometer, ionized, accelerated and analyzed by
  mass spectrometry.

MS(2)
  Ions from MS1 spectra are then selectively fragmented and analyzed by a second stage of mass spectrometry (MS2) to
  generate the spectra for the ion fragments.

MS/MS
  Tandem mass spectrometry, MS^2^, a technique where two or more mass analyzers are coupled together using an additional
  reaction step to increase their abilities to analyse chemical samples.

Collision-induced dissociation (CID)
  A mass spectrometry technique to induce fragmentation of selected ions in the gas phase. Also known as Collision
  induced dissociation.
