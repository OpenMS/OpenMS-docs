File Handling
============

## General information about peak and feature maps

For general information about a peak or feature map, use the **FileInfo** tool.

- It can print RT, m/z and intensity ranges, the overall number of peaks, and the distribution of MS levels.
- It can print a statistical summary of intensities.
- It can print some meta information.
- It can validate XML files against their schema.
- It can check for corrupt data in peak files See the `FileInfo â€“help` for details.

## Problems with input files

If you are experiencing problems while processing an XML file, check if the file does validate against the XML schema:

`FileInfo -v -in infile.mzML`

Validation is available for several file formats including mzML, mzData, mzXML, featureXML and idXML.

Another frequently-occurring problem is corrupt data. You can check for corrupt data in peak files with `FileInfo` as well:

`FileInfo -c -in infile.mzML`

## Converting your files to mzML

The TOPP tools work only on the HUPO-PSI `mzML` format. If you need to convert *mzData*, *mzXML* or *ANDI/MS* data to
*mzML*, use the FileConverter, e.g.

`FileConverter -in infile.mzXML -out outfile.mzML`

For format names as file extension, the tool derives the format from the extension. For other extensions, the file
formats of the input and output file can be given explicitly.

## Converting between DTA and mzML

Sequest DTA files can be extracted from a mzML file using the `DTAExtractor`:

`DTAExtractor -in infile.mzML -out outfile`

The retention time of a scan, the precursor mass-to-charge ratio (for MS/MS scans) and the file extension are appended
to the output file name.

To combine several files (e.g. DTA files) to an `mzML` file use the `FileMerger`:

`FileMerger -in infile_list.txt -out outfile.mzML`

The retention times of the scans can be generated, taken from the `infile_list.txt` or can be extracted from the DTA
file names. See the FileMerger documentation for details.

## Extracting part of the data from a file

To extract part of the data from an `mzML` file, use the `FileFilter` tool. It allows filtering for RT, `m/z` and
intensity range or for MS level. To extract the MS/MS scans between retention time `100` and `1500`, use the following
command:

`FileFilter -in infile.mzML -levels 2 -rt 100:1500 -out outfile.mzML`
