What is OpenMS?
===============

OpenMS is an open-source software platform designed for the analysis and visualization of high-throughput mass spectrometry data. OpenMS has been designed to operate on all platforms, and provides a flexible framework for users to access a wide range of built-in tools or build their own tools using the existing functionality. These tools can be applied separately to data or be applied in sequence (as a workflow or pipeline) to mass spectrometry data. OpenMS is well established and has been used widely in [literature](https://openms.github.io/publications/), particularly in the life sciences.

Fields such as proteomics and metabolomics require the rapid, large-scale identification, quantification and characterization of biomolecules which traditional analytical techniques struggle to offer. OpenMS has been created by a team of biologists and computer scientists to create a completely open-source solution that offers customisable tools for high-throughput processing of mass spectrometry data.

OpenMS provides a number of tools built from a C++ core library. These tools are collectively referred to as “The OpenMS PiPeline (TOPP) (formerly known as The OpenMS Proteomic Pipeline) tools. TOPP tools can be chained in a sequence to form workflows and can be applied to mass spectrometry data.
Note: TOPP’s capabilities have been expanded to apply to a wide range of areas in the life sciences.
