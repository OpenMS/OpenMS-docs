TOPP
===

**TOPP - The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline** is a pipeline for the analysis of HPLC-MS data. It consists of several small
applications that can be chained to create analysis pipelines tailored for a specific problem.

The TOPP tools are divided into several subgroups, like graphical tools, file handling, signal processing and
preprocessing, quantitation, map alignment, protein/peptide identification, protein/peptide processing, targeted
experiments and OpenSWATH, peptide property prediction, cross-linking, quality-control, among a few.

Few of the graphical tools are explained below:

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

toppview: A viewer for mass spectrometry data.
toppas: An assistant for GUI-driven TOPP workflow design.
ini-file-editor: An editor for OpenMS configuration files.
swathwizard: A user-friendly step-by-step wizard for SWATH data analysis.
```

For advanced documentation on every TOPP tool, see the [OpenMS TOPP API Reference](https://abibuilder.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/archive/openms/Documentation/nightly/html/TOPP_documentation.html).
